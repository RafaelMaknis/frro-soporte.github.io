=======================

MinimalXYZ [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) theme is extended from [minimalXY](https://github.com/petrnohejl/MinimalXY) by [petrnohejl](https://github.com/petrnohejl).

This is a custom implementation of the MinimalXY Pelican theme for [this website](elc.github.io) and therefore I won't be working on this theme actively.
